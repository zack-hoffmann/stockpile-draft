                <p>Stockpile Draft is a game format which combines the planning aspects of popular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deck-building_game">deck-building games</a> with the deep gameplay of Magic.  It is a multiplayer format which uses a specially-crafted <a href="https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Cube_Draft">cube</a> that players acquire cards from as they play the game.</p>

                <h2>Basic Rules</h2>
                <p>Except where noted below, games of Stockpile Draft follow the same rules as a normal multiplayer game of Magic: the Gathering.</p>
                <h3>Setup</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Stockpiles: From a provided cube, create six 25-card face-down stockpiles.  Do not look at them.  Cards in stockpiles are not owned by any player.</li>
                    <li>The Junkpile: The cube should also come with 25 specially marked "junk" cards.  These can be any card where the front side clearly indicates that they are junk and the back side (or sleeve) is indistinguishable from other cards played in the cube.  Since junk cards are all the same - they do nothing - this pile can be face-up.</li>
                    <li>The Landpile: The cube should also come with a large, shuffled pile of basic lands, evenly distributed among basic land types.  This pile can be face-up.</li>
                    <li>Each player takes three cards from the junkpile and seven random, face-down cards from the landpile then shuffles them all together.  This is the player's starting deck, and no one - including that player - should know which basic lands they are given.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Starting the Game</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Turn the top card of each stockpile face up.</li>
                    <li>The player going first takes a card form the junkpile and places it in their graveyard.</li>
                    <li>Instead of drawing a starting hand of seven cards from their library, each player draws a starting hand of five cards.  Players cannot mulligan.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Gameplay</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Play with the top card of each stockpile revealed.  Although not owned by any player, any player may cast (or play, for lands) these cards as though they are in their hand.  However, they are not considered to be in the hand for effects which care about that.</li>
                    <li>Once a player casts or plays a card from a stockpile that player becomes the owner of that card.</li>
                    <li>Players do not draw a card during their draw step.</li>
                    <li>During cleanup step, instead of discarding cards until reaching maximum hand size the active player discards their hand and then draws five cards.</li>
                    <li>If a player would draw one or more cards from their library - including during cleanup as noted above - but there are no cards remaining then that player shuffles their graveyard in to their library and proceeds to draw the remaining cards.  This is a special action which does not grant priority to any player.</li>
                    <li>Players may use lands from the landpile for their normal land play action.  However, each time a land is played from the landpile this way that player must put a card from the junkpile in to their graveyard.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Comprehensive Rules</h2>
                <p>Except where noted below, games of Stockpile Draft follow the standard <a href="http://media.wizards.com/2017/downloads/MagicCompRules_20170707.pdf">Magic: the Gathering Comprehensive Rules</a>.</p>
                <h3>Game Concepts</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Players do not construct their own decks prior to beginning a game.</li>
                    <li>A "cube" (pre-selected set of cards) must be provided for playing this game, as well as a set of 25 specially marked "junk" cards (see Card Types below).</li>
                    <li>Before the start of the game...
                        <ul>
                            <li>Set the 25 junk cards in a pile.  This is the "junkpile" (see Zones below).</li>
                            <li>Select 150 cards at random face-down from the cube and separate them in to 6 face-down piles of 25 cards.  These Players cannot know the cards selected until they are revealed during the course of the game.  These are the "stockpiles" (see Zones below).</li>
                            <li>Set out a large number (at least 10 per player) of basic lands, evenly distributed among basic land types.  Shuffle them together.  This is the "landpile" (see Zones below).</li>
                            <li>For each player, take 3 cards from the junkpile and 7 cards selected at random face-down from the landpile.  Shuffle them together.  This becomes the player's starting deck for the game.  They may not look at their deck prior to - or during - the game.  Therefor they cannot know which basic lands their starting deck contains until they are drawn.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Card Types</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Junk
                        <ul>
                            <li>Junk cards are any card which has been specially marked as such.  Because no official junk cards have been printed the provider of the cube should also provide the junk cards.  A junk card can be any card whose back side is indistinguishable from any other card being played in the cube.  The cube provider must clearly indicate what marks a card as a junk card.</li>
                            <li>The purpose of a junk card is to have no function during the game other than to be a card in a deck.</li>
                            <li>A junk card has no characteristics of a card other than the card type being "Junk". i.e. it has no name, color, mana cost, text, etc..</li>
                            <li>Because a junk card has no mana cost, it cannot be cast.  If a junk card would be placed on to the stack it must be immediately moved to its owner's graveyard.</li>
                            <li>Because a junk card does not represent a permanent, it cannot be put on to the battlefield.  If a junk card would be put on to the battlefield it must be moved to its owner's graveyard.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
